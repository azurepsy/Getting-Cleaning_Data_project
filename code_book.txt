code book for tidy_data.txt

This code book indicates the variable names in the tidy data set and their changes in name from the original data.


sid: subject id, representing the test subjects. 
     Its values are integers from 1~30, readin from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt


test: test activity, representing the activity names. 
      Its values are characters from one of "WALKING", "UPSTAIRS", "DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING" 
      readin from activity_labels and modified as belows:
      "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" changes to "UPSTAIRS"
      "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" changes to "DOWNSTAIRES"  
 
The following values are for each sid and test, please refer to features_info.txt for details of names.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

the set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: mean of mean value for each subject and activity
std: mean of standard deviation for each subject and activity

For example:

tBodyAcc-mean-X is the mean value of body acceleration in X direction for each subject and test activity.
